# CODE-LISTING-AUTUMN
EE 1042 AUTUMN PROJECT 
# Line Following Vehicle Project

This GitHub repository contains the code for the Line Following Vehicle project. The project is organized into two main components: `function` and `trackchallenge`.

## Function

The `function` directory contains individual functions that correspond to specific components or functionalities of the line following vehicle. Each file focuses on a particular aspect, making the code modular and easy to manage. Here is a brief overview of the functions:

- **Angle Function**: Code related to calculating and handling angles, particularly for incline surfaces using a 6-axis motion sensor.

- **Bluetooth Code**: Bluetooth communication code for remote control or interaction.

- **Distance Function**: Code for measuring the distance traveled, utilizing a rotary encoder.

- **Movement Function**: Functions responsible for controlling the movement of the vehicle, including forward, backward, turning, and stopping.

- **PID Control**: Implementation of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control for maintaining and adjusting the vehicle's speed.

- **Ultrasonic Code**: Code related to obstacle detection and avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.

## Track Challenge

The `trackchallenge` directory contains the code used to complete the track challenge. This code makes use of the functions defined in the `function` directory. Not all functions may be called during the track challenge, depending on the specific requirements of the challenge.

Feel free to explore the code in each directory for a deeper understanding of the project's implementation.

## Usage

To use this code, you can adapt the functions for your specific hardware or integrate them into your own robotics project. Make sure to review the comments within each file for guidance on usage and customization.
